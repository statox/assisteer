        <h2>Welcome to Assisteer your personal Astroneer Assistant!</h2>
        <p>
            This tool was made to help me plan my projects when I'm playing astroneer.
            I've realized that most of the time when I want to create a factory or any complex system
            I have to go back and forth between the research catalogue to find out which resources I need,
            then I have to remember all the objects I want to create, realize that I'm missing one resource,
            wander around to find the resource, then forget what I was doing and feel frustrated.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I made this simple tool to help me plan my projects and maybe it can be useful to you too!
        </p>
        <p>
            Simply select the different objects you plan to make, choose the quantity and let the app tell you
            which resources you need, in which quantity and with which tools.
        </p>
        <h2>How it's made</h2>
        <p>
            To list the existing objects in the game I manually parsed <a href="https://astroneer.fandom.com/wiki/Astroneer_Wiki">the wiki</a>
            and turned the information into typescript files.
        </p>
        <p>
            None of the images on this app belong to me, they are actually hosted by the wiki and were created
            either by <a href="https://astroneer.space/">System Era Softwork</a> or the wiki users.
            I also took some inspiration for the design from the wiki.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything else is my own work and the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/statox/assisteer">on Github</a>.
            The graph part is made with <a href="https://js.cytoscape.org/">CytoscapeJS</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>But it sucks!</h2>
        <p>
            I hear you fellow astroneer! This app is missing some objects that I might add in the future.
            I also plan on fixing some UI issues at one point and on adding more features like a power consumption
            analysis of your project and a required storage count. But all of that might never happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime I strongly encourage you to check <a href="https://astroneer.projects.matco.name/">this other
                astroneer companion app</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/matco">Matthieu Corageoud</a> it is
            more complete than this app, has a nice UI and works quite well.
